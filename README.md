# Optimizing-Medicare-Reimbursement-Strategies-A-Machine-Learning-Approach-at-Metro-Health-Systems

The main aim of this study is to determine, examine, and forecast the factors that affect the differences in Medicare reimbursements among the different services and local facilities run by Metro Health Systems. Metro Health Systems selected the bagging ensemble approach due to its resilience in mitigating variance and enhancing prediction accuracy. The study employed a methodical machine learning procedure, starting with data preprocessing to address issues related to data cleaning in a useful manner. It heavily relied on feature engineering to extract significant qualities from unprocessed data, including service complexity scores and provider efficiency ratings.
